Ideas for rewarding player: 
Letting players use their prize money to buy accessories for their playable character and/or pet
Letting players use their prize money to buy different decorations for their home screen/default screen of the game
Letting players use their prize money to buy different themes for the games (different colors, different shapes, different backgrounds, etc.)
Letting players buy advantages for games -- (Something like 2x the points for each bubble popped)
Letting users buy different avatars (they can pick one at the start, but have to buy the others)
Everything that can be bought should get more expensive each time the player buys something.

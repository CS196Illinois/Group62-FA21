Build a game that is a collection of stress-relieving mini games. This will include a central home screen where you can chose which games to play. We will also include a feature that will track overall wellness of the user and will reward them based on the mini-games that they play.

We need to make a homescreen which will allow for access of all the mini-games and show the user some general info about how many games they have played or what their rewards are from playing the games. Some of the ideas for our mini-games included popping bubbles, organizing items, sand simulation, and pouring liquid simulation.

For Sprint 2:
  - Create the homescreen and make it somewhat versatile so we can easily add any mini-games that we create along the way. The homescreen also should have info about the general wellness of the user or something that can pull up a detailed description of what we are tracking.
  - Create at least one mini-game. This can be any of the ones we discussed or we can start with something different if it is easier/more convenient.
  - Think about how we can reward the user for the games they complete and how we can track their overall wellness.
